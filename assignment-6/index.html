      Across all areas of media (film, television, theater etc.)
      there is a glaring lack of representation for people with disabilities.
      From the absence of proper representation of the challenges of mental health,
      to the lack of physically disabled and people with invisible disability, there are
      huge pockets of the population that don't see themselves represented on screen.
      This Buzzfeed video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ykXguKWqy4"> here </a>
      describes just a slice of the problem.

<p><q>It’s profound giving storylines like that to a deformed person is radical. We’re the first disabled people on US TV, but this is a show about freaks, so they see me and think ‘good casting’. A world where if even your teeth are wrong you don’t get gigs? It’s a tough nut to crack.</q>-Mat Fraser on being an actor with disabilities on American Horror Story</p>
