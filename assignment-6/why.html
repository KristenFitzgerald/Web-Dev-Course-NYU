      <h1> Why is representation important? </h1>
      <h2> So, why is this important? Why is it important for people with disabilities to not only see characters but also actors
         of disability? First off, representation is so important--for kids growing up differently abled, not seeing themselves on screen
         can be hugely demoralizing, and can feel like they don't exist in the world (even more so for disabled minorities who get even less screen time).
         And secondly, seeing disabled character is exceptionally important for able-bodied audience members; the media is a great way of educating many
         poeple on the subject and increasing sensitivity to people who are different.
